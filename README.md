# NMRiH Community Maps
This repository is for submitting issues related to community maps, many of which have been long abandoned. 

The goal of the project is to aid the creation of Steam Workshop scripts, known as maphacks, which can tackle these issues externally. It might also prove useful to active level designers and their projects.

### Submitting a new issue

- Search through existing issues to see if yours has already been reported.
- Make sure it's reproducible using the latest Steam version of the game. e.g no [1.09.6 walkie-boosting](https://github.com/nmrih/source-game/issues/805).
- Write a descriptive title, prefixed by the map's file name. e.g.`[nmo_subside_v5] Car jack spawns out of bounds`
- Provide a detailed summary. What, where, how. Reproduction steps, screenshots and videos come a long way.

### General guidelines
- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.
- Avoid using ALL CAPS when creating a report.
- Do not repeatedly update an open issue, saying that the issue persists.
- Don't request new features. A map's core gameplay and mechanics will be left as-is.
